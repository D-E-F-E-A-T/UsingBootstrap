For this project I used Bootstrap, CSS-grid, flex-box and floats to position the elements on the page. The goal was to recreate Newsweek page.
I tried to use Bootstrap as much as possible. The use of semantic HTML tags was also very important for me. I feel like I have a long time
to go when it comese to learning Bootstap but I think this project really made me realize how Bootstap can help me in my future endavours.
